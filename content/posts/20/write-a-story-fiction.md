## intro
A hexalogy [^kraljik_2022], but stil unfinished, is reposting in nou [^viridi_2024a] with permission after about 17 years it was published on Lulu in 3 May 2007 as whole [^arimasen_2007]. The reposting is still in progress only Elemen Kekosongan and Seratus Hari are finished today. Next 4 stories will follow.

Inspired by the story during the reposting process, I just think whether I can write as flowing as Nein did. The only story I have written to cover 9 minutes was some mixture of everyting [^viridi_2024b]. Peharps I should give a try, shouldn't I? Today I just create this introduction part and the rest will follow soon, hopefully. :laughing: Or use the mother language instead of English? I might be easier, right? Well, let's see.
