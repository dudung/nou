## intro
The term log might sound familiar to some people. Long time before computer era, a form of log entry record-keeping, that was used since the first captains sailed Earthâ€™s seas in ancient history, is known as Captain's log, which records what was happening on a mission and to record historical facts for future generations [^wu_2017]. In computing context a log is the automatically produced and time-stamped documentation of events relevant to a particular system, where virtually all software applications and systems produce log files [^wigmore_2014].

Then related to inventory, there is a log tracks the movement of commodity, including materials and goods, by code, where it records movement of full cases and units, which is known a inventory log [^beening_2002]. Similar to commodity, there is patient log, which records detailed information about clinical encounter with patient [^exxat_2024]. For materials as given in a course, there is lecture log that records short description of the material covered in each lecture [^petrides_2012]. Even the last three examples of logs given are in computer era, they exist before the time when hard copy forms still be used.

Previous examples are intended for private use or at least institutional use. Then with the internet and its spirits [^bahba_2014], other types of logs arise such as blog, vlog, slog [^ghebremichael_2019] and plog [^harper_2023], which stand for weblog, video blog, sound log, and photoblog. Notice that the second is not sound blog, sound log, which is the recorded audio file of a blog post.

I would like to make the log, as much as possible, in plain text with additional features if necessary, e.g. LaTeX with MathJax or KaTeX, diagrams with Mermaid, formatted text with Markdown, sheet music with abcjs, molecules visualization with 3Dmol.js, charts with Chart.js, and others with HTML.
