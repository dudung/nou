Find right resource to install Llama locallya <!--more-->


## intro
A six-days-ago story on Medium about installing Llama 3 locally [^krishnan_2024], triggers me to learn about Llama. It sounds so simple and I can not believe it right away, since the steps to install Llama 2 is not so easy [^bawa_2023]. How install Llama 1 can not be found. OOT, even there is a lot advantages of LLM, but there is also carbon impact to be considered [^kamp_2023].
